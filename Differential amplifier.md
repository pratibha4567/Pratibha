# Experiment 3

Aim: design and analyse the most differential amplifier circuit for the following specifications Vdd=2.5V,P<= 3mW,Vicm=1.3V,Vocm=1.4V,Vp=0.5V. Perform DC analysis transient analysis and frequency response and extract the required parameters.

Introduction:
A Differential Amplifier is an electronic circuit that takes two input signals and gives an output.

The key concept of using differential amplifier is to
